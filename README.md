- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Hansen

- I'm an analyst, engineer and digital marketer with a passion for data-focused projects. Currently, I work as an Analytics Engineer at Clearlink.
I focus on creating automations, data pipelines, transformations, enabling web analytics and more with a variety of languages and tools 
(Python, SQL, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Google Analytics, Tag Manager, Data Studio, etc.). My goal is to work on more data science focused projects this year.
In 2021, I graduated from the University of Utah with a Master's degree in Information Systems and a Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics. I strive to continuously learn, progress and positively impact those around me.
